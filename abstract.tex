This technical note describes an analysis to determine SK detector systematics
in various detector regions. The detector systematics are parameterized and
then constrained by comparing simulated data to SK atmospheric neutrino control samples using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.  The detector systematics are then used to determine 
the optimal fiducial volume cuts for the fiTQun-only T2K event selections.  Finally, we
estimate the overall detector uncertainties for the fiTQun sample so that they may
be propagated to the T2K oscillation analyses.
